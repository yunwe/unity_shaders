# Shaders
Collection of unity shaders I tested in my free time. Currently, they are from the [shader course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unity-shaders/) I'm learning from Udemy. But, I'm planning to add new things as I progress in my learning and crafting. 

Here is the list of shader in my collection
  - Glass
  - Glass Model
  
## Examples
- Glass

- Glass Model

In order to achieve this effect, please make sure to select "Normal" to "Calculate", and set "Smoothing Angel" to 0 in model's import setting.
