# Shaders
Collection of unity shaders I tested in my free time. Currently, they are from the [shader course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unity-shaders/) I'm learning from Udemy. But, I'm planning to add new things as I progress in my learning and crafting. 

Here is the list of shader in my collection
