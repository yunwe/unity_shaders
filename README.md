# Shaders
Collection of unity shaders I tested in my free time. Some of them are from the [shader course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unity-shaders/) I'm learning from Udemy. But, I'm adding new things as I progress in my learning and crafting. 

Here is the list of shader in my collection
  - Glass
  - Glass Model
  - SafeZone
  
## Examples
- Glass

- Glass Model
In order to achieve this effect, please make sure to select `Normals = Calculate`, and set `Smoothing Angel = 0` in model's import setting.
